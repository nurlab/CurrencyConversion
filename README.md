## üß™ Sample Users for Testing

Use the following sample accounts to interact with the API. Each account has a predefined role that determines the level of access to the various currency conversion endpoints.

| Username | Password  |
|----------|-----------|
| Admin    | Hello1!@  |
| Manager  | Hello1!@  |
| User     | Hello1!@  | 

### üîê Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

Each role is associated with specific permissions to access certain API endpoints:

- **Admin (Role ID: 1)**: access to the latest exchange rate endpoint:
  - `GET /get-latest-exchange-rate`: Retrieve the latest exchange rates for a specified base currency.

- **Manager (Role ID: 2)**: access to the currency conversion endpoint:
  - `POST /convert`: Convert an amount from one currency to another.

- **User (Role ID: 3)**: accessing historical exchange rate data:
  - `POST /get-rate-history`: Retrieve historical exchange rates for a given date range.

## üìå Assumptions

- Role numbers (1, 2, 3) are directly input by the user.
- Excluded currencies (TRY, PLN, THB, MXN) will result in a `400 Bad Request`.
- Exchange rate provider is [Frankfurter API](https://www.frankfurter.app/).
- No frontend is included in this submission.
- Swagger is the primary interface for testing.

# üöÄ Possible Future Enhancements

1. **Microservices Architecture for Scalability**
   - **Description**: Break down the monolithic application into smaller, independently deployable microservices, each focused on a specific domain (e.g., currency conversion, user management, rate fetching). This will allow each service to scale independently based on demand.
   - **Benefit**: Improves scalability and flexibility, enabling you to allocate resources efficiently. It also makes the system more resilient since failures in one service do not affect the others.

2. **Event-Driven Architecture (EDA)**
   - **Description**: Introduce an event-driven approach with event brokers like Kafka or RabbitMQ. For instance, currency conversion requests can trigger events (e.g., for logging, notifications, or updates to external systems).
   - **Benefit**: Enhances the system's scalability and responsiveness. It decouples services, allowing them to process events asynchronously, reducing the risk of bottlenecks.

3. **CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)**
   - **Description**: Implement CQRS where the system is split into two parts: one handling commands (writes/updates) and another for queries (reads). This could be beneficial for operations that involve frequent read/write operations, such as currency conversions and rate history queries.
   - **Benefit**: Improves performance and scalability, especially for high-read or high-write applications. It also allows for better optimization and more efficient handling of complex queries.

4. **API Gateway**
   - **Description**: Use an API Gateway (e.g., Ocelot in .NET Core) to centralize API routing, load balancing, and rate limiting. This will act as a front-facing layer for client applications, routing requests to the appropriate backend services.
   - **Benefit**: Simplifies the system architecture, provides centralized management of cross-cutting concerns like security, logging, and rate limiting, and reduces the burden on individual microservices.

5. **Multi-Provider Integration**
   - **Description**: Currently, the API relies on a single exchange rate provider (e.g., Frankfurter API). Future versions could integrate multiple providers (e.g., Open Exchange Rates, CurrencyLayer) to provide redundancy, better availability, and potentially more accurate rates.
   - **Benefit**: This would improve the resilience and reliability of the service in case one provider becomes unavailable or has inaccuracies.

6. **Asynchronous Processing and Queuing**
   - **Description**: For more complex operations or bulk currency conversion, introduce asynchronous processing and queuing (e.g., using **Azure Queue Storage** or **RabbitMQ**).
   - **Benefit**: This would allow the API to process requests in the background, improving responsiveness for long-running operations.

7. **Geolocation-Based Currency Detection**
   - **Description**: Add support for automatic currency detection based on the user‚Äôs geographical location. This could be done using an IP-to-country mapping service.
   - **Benefit**: Provides a more user-friendly experience by automatically selecting the base currency based on the user's location.

8. **Currency Conversion History and Analytics**
   - **Description**: Store historical conversion data in a database (e.g., **SQL Server** or **NoSQL** like **MongoDB**) and allow users to query historical conversion history. This could be used for analytics or reporting.
   - **Benefit**: Adds value for users who want to track historical trends or perform more advanced analysis on currency conversion data.

9. **Audit Logging for User Actions**
